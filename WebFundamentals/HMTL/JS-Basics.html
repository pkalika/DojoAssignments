           <h1>JavaScript Basics</h1>
           <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
             JavaScript is extremely popular for variety of reasons. Its a small
             and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers
             to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside
             a host environment (a web browser or node server), it can be connected
             to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control
             over them. </p>

               <ul class ="c"
                <li> <b>Variable Declaration:</b> JavaScript Variables are containers
                    for storing data values -imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the
                    cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. </li>
                <li> <b>Variable Assignment:</b> Assignment operators is equal ( = ),
                   which assigns the value of its right operand to its left operand.
                   That is, x = y assigns the value of y to x . The other assignment
                    operators are usually shorthand for standard operations, as shown
                    in the following definitions and examples  </li>
                <li> <b>Data Types:</b>  </li>

                <li> <b>Conditionals:</b> The keyword if tells JavaScript to start the
                  conditional statement. (10 > 5) is the condition to test, which in this
                   case is true — 10 is greater than 5 . The part contained inside curly
                   braces {} is the block of code to run. Because the condition passes,
                   the variable outcome is assigned the value "if block" . </li>

                <li> <b>Loops:</b> supports different kinds of loops: ... for/in - loops
                   through the properties of an object. while - loops through a block of
                    code while a specified condition is true. do/while - also loops
                    through a block of code while a specified condition is true. </li>

                <li> <b>Funtions:</b> are one of the fundamental building blocks in
                  JavaScript. A function is a JavaScript procedure—a set of statements
                  that performs a task or calculates a value.  </li>
